Goal: Create a program that calculates the cost of a three-tiered service 
	* program is a quote service that continually allows user request quotes 
	* after user enter quote, program prompts user to continue or quit 
	* assume software will run at least once 

Calculating Cost:
	[(# unit requested - #unit cap) * additional fee] + base fee

Validity Checking:
* user input for package
	- must be: B, b, S, s, D, d
	- must reprompt if user enter character other than above character 
	- continue to prompt user until a valid package is chosen 
	- don't error check for multiple characters, assume user will enter once character 

* number of service units
	- must be between 1 and 1000 inclusive 
	- prompt user for value again if they enter a value outside of that range
	- MUST be an integer, no need for error checking however

Cost Savings:
* program must inform user if it would be less expensive to change plans and display the cost savings 
------------------------------------------------------------
Other notes:
* calculate the cost of each package everytime the user enters a number of units; however, you only need to display
  the quote the user wanted (implement using a switch case)

===============================================
1) Prompt user for package input:
	- create char variable to store user input [X]
	- prompt user for input [X]
	- read user input into char variable [X]
	- test if char variable is valid input [X]
	- if invalid, prompt again until valid [X]
	- if valid store input and save for later processing [X]

=================================================
2) getQuote() - selects case then calls function to calculate cost for each package
	- function takes the package and the number of units and returns the cost
	- uses a switch case for each package
	- selects the appropriate case based on the package character
	- int each case call the function to calculate the cost of each package based on teh number
	  of unit - has a return value for variable named cost
	- no return value
