Description:
[X] 1) prompt user for 3 integers: midterm grade, project average, homework average

[X] 2) display which of these are the highest so far (will be output at a %)

[X] 3) display which of the three is the lowest so far (will be output as a %)

4) Compute the student's overall average and display it 
	- midterm is 20% of overall
	- project average is 40% of overall 
	- homework is 15% of overall 

	** Will need to work out how this computation will work ** 

5) Display if any of the grades are failing (below 70%)

NOTES:
	* figure out what to do in the case of a tie in grades 

	* don't worry about error checking 

	* when computing the avearge figure out if all 100s first, if so no need to compute

============================================================================================
Program by Cases:

Case 1: m==p==h (no need to do any further processing)
	- output that all 3 grades are equivalent 
	- average is the same value as the grades (no need to compute)
	- test if grades are failing (<70%)
		- if failing, then ouput the student is failing 

Case 2: m==p (only these two are equivalent)
	- output that m==p
	-
