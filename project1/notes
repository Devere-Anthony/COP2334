Description:
[X] 1) prompt user for 3 integers: midterm grade, project average, homework average

[X] 2) display which of these are the highest so far (will be output at a %)

[X] 3) display which of the three is the lowest so far (will be output as a %)

4) Compute the student's overall average and display it 
	- midterm is 20% of overall
	- project average is 40% of overall 
	- homework is 15% of overall 

	** Will need to work out how this computation will work ** 

5) Display if any of the grades are failing (below 70%)

NOTES:
	* figure out what to do in the case of a tie in grades 

	* don't worry about error checking 

	* when computing the avearge figure out if all 100s first, if so no need to compute

============================================================================================
failTest()
- takes a vector of grade values (ints)
- iterate over the vector
	- test if each is below 70
	- if they are, add them to a failing vector

- pass failing vector to name conversion function to get names of failing subjects
	- iterate failing vector 
	- call name conversion function with the failing vector and the grade
